  timing:
    sweep_duration: 2.0        # seconds
    baseline_duration: 0.5     # seconds before stimulus
    stimulus_duration: 1.0     # seconds
    post_stimulus: 0.5         # seconds after stimulus
    inter_sweep_interval: 10   # seconds between sweeps

  stimulus:

    start_amplitude: -100      # pA
    end_amplitude: 300         # pA

  expected_responses:
    - "passive_response"       # sweeps with negative current
    - "subthreshold"           # small positive current
    - "action_potentials"      # larger positive current
